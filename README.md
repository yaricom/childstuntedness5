## Overview
Stunting (i.e., shortness for age) affects more than one in four children worldwide. Wasting (i.e., being underweight for age) 
and stunting in early childhood are associated with lethargy, reduced levels of play, an increased risk of early death, 
higher burden of disease, compromised physical capacities, and diminished cognitive development. Stunting and wasting in 
the first two years of life have been shown to be associated with lower school attainment and reduced economic productivity. 
This can reduce the productivity of an entire generation. Furthermore, stunting between 12 and 36 months has also been linked 
to poor cognitive performance and/or lower school grades in middle childhood, and both height and head circumference at 2 
years have been shown to be inversely associated with educational attainment.

In this challenge, we explore the link between cognitive development and child stuntedness. While stuntedness is known to 
correlate with poor cognitive development, we are interested in finding out if this is reversible. Are there children who 
were born stunted but nevertheless are able to successfully overcome their slow cognitive development rates later in life? 
Furthermore, do children born stunted who overcome their small size (perhaps by adequate nutrition) also show increased 
cognitive ability? Are there external factors (either inherited from the parents or environmental) which can contribute 
positively to this recovery?

### Special Conditions
Additional requirement was to create crafted algorithm which may be compilled and runned in the AWS runner with following limits:
- Example tests are limited to 360s (6 minutes), 
- provisional tests to 540s (9 minutes) 
- system tests to 900s (15 minutes).

The main algorithm runner implemented in: [ChildStuntedness5.h](https://github.com/yaricom/childstuntedness5/blob/master/ChildStuntedness5/ChildStuntedness5/ChildStuntedness5.h)
